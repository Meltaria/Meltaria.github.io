## Introduction
My name is Yuchen Hua, currently a graduate student of Bostatistics in [Columbia University Irving Medical Center](https://www.cuimc.columbia.edu/). I used to be a undergraduate student in [Brandeis University](https://www.brandeis.edu/), Waltham. During my undergraduate period, I majored in Biochemistry. Some research and internship were done during this period. 

My hobby is [ACG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACG_(subculture)) and music. Japanese ancient and pop culture, such as game, [manga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manga), [samurai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samurai),  and pop music interest me a lot. 
I played piano so I did have strong interest in [classical music](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_music), especially in [Mozart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfgang_Amadeus_Mozart)'s music.

## Study experience
In my undergraduate period, I majored in Biochemistry. Some basic courses, such as Math, Biology: Genome & Genetics, Physics and Chemistry. Some biochemistry required courses were also achieved, such as Classical and Statistical Thermodynamics.

My research and internship experience in this period was basicly about drug development and pharmacy. 
Now I am a student of [Biostatistics](https://www.publichealth.columbia.edu/academics/departments/biostatistics) in CUMC, track [public health data science (PHDS)](https://www.publichealth.columbia.edu/academics/degrees/master-science/public-health-data-science).

## Personal Interest
I may say I am a great fan in Japanese culture, both their traditional culture, such as samurai, [kabuki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kabuki) and [Katana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katana), and their pop culture, such as their [Tokusatsu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokusatsu) (eg.Ultraman), and [anime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anime). 

The first time I played the game, [Sekiro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sekiro:_Shadows_Die_Twice), I was strongly attracted by its art style and strong Japanese atmosphere.

I played piano since I was young, so I did have learn a lot about classical music. 

My favorite composer should be Mozart, whose talent seemed to be God-blessed and extraordinary. The opera, [Magic Flute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Magic_Flute), was so famous and magnificent that it was hardly described in words. I highly recommended it.
