## Research Experience
#### Computational Study of COVID-19 Antibodies and Structural Implications on Future Antibody Development

__=> Shanghai Jiao Tong University, School of Pharmacy (Advisor : Prof. Buyong Ma)__        07-08/2021

The structural analysis of the antibody complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) is critical for antibody discovery and development. In this project, I used computational methods and tools to disassemble the diverse COVID-19 antibodies and then conducted statistical analysis on the structural information of amino acid pairs on CDRs to identify the critical interactions and accordingly give implications on future COVID-19 antibody development.

#### Review of Different Glucose-responsive Insulin Treatments for Type I Diabetes, the Corresponding Biomaterials, and Drug Delivery Methods

__=>Cornell University, Collaborative Online Research (Advisor: Prof. Minglin Ma)__  08-09/2020

With two team members, we conducted literature review to summarize the mechanisms and biomaterials used by four up-to-date glucose-responsive insulin treatments, compared the prons and cons between different drug delivery methods, and critically analyzed the challenges each faces.
The review paper is published on Solid State Technology.

## Internship

#### Soochwo University Affiliated Dushu Lack Hospital
__=>Summer Research Intern (Supervisor : Dr. Yafeng Zhou, Vasculocardiology Department)__  06-07/2019
As a research assistant, I helped organize and clean the clinical data of >100 patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) to verify the efficacy of a new drug treatment. In another research, I used SPSS to perform univariate and multivariate analyses to identify the emotional risk factors â€“ depression and anxiety in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) diseases.
